Hello, Welcome to github repository for MyCloudTutorials.com. My name is Girish Jaju. This repository has code that I will be creating for various tutorials and videos for cloud technologies demo and courses, especially for AWS cloud.

To effectively use the examples, you should have <br/>
- An AWS account with Admin access <br/>
- Basic understanding of AWS IAM, User Roles etc.
- Understanding of Python and Node


For any questions, project/consulting needs, you can reach me at mycloudtutorials@gmail.com
